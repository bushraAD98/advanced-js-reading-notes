# Middleware :
* what is middleware? 

is a specially designed software where two different programs can interact with each other.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware in the stack.

*****

# Request Object :
request is when the user send information or request in this case information from a server, there are two common requests, the first one is GET and the second one is POST.

## Request Object
The request object is passed as the first parameter on the request handler, and it has information about the userâ€™s request.

******

# Response Object :

The res object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.

******

# Test Driven Development  (TDD) :
 is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.

 How to perform TDD Test :

Add a test.
Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
Write some code.
Run tests and Refactor code.
Repeat.

******

# Behavior driven testing :
Behavior driven testing are most often focused on the behavior of users rather than the technical functions of the software , BDT is the best choice when you want to show your business point of view and the requirements of the product

## How Behavior Driven Testing implemented?

Business Analyst writes a formal User story.
Tester writes the scenarios based on the user story.
Scenarios get reviewed by the business team.
Automation engineer writes the step definitions for the scenario steps.
Scenarios get automated by the QA team.
Run the automated scenarios and fix if any bugs exist.
Automated tests run as regression tests.
User accepts the software (Acceptance and Quality Criteria met)


*********

Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
on BDT
Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

the midleware .


What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

I like testing so i would like to do a BDT or learn more about TDD.
