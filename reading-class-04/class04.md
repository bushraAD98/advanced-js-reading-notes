# sql vs nosql :
## sql : (structred query language)
 its a type of relational database , where there is a tables & relations between them we declare a spesific schema and all the records have to follow that schema & we can connect many tables with each other by a relation

types of relations :
- one to one
- one to many 
- many to many



## nosql(mongo db) :

stands for (humongus) because it can store lots & lots of data .

the interesting thing is nosql that it has no schema so the data inside it not suppose to follow the schema it its shape , here in nosql instead of tables we have collections & instead of records we have documents 

* disadvantage of nosql :
having some duplicated data .

# Functional Programming :

Functional programming languages are specially designed to handle symbolic computation and list processing applications. Functional programming is based on mathematical functions. Some of the popular functional programming languages include: Lisp, Python, Erlang, Haskell, Clojure, etc.

Functional programming languages are categorized into two groups, i.e. −

Pure Functional Languages − These types of functional languages support only the functional paradigms. For example − Haskell.

Impure Functional Languages − These types of functional languages support the functional paradigms and imperative style programming. For example − LISP.

## Functional Programming – Characteristics :

- Functional programming languages are designed on the concept of mathematical functions that use conditional expressions and recursion to perform computation.

- Functional programming supports higher-order functions and lazy evaluation features.

- Functional programming languages don’t support flow Controls like loop statements and conditional statements like If-Else and Switch Statements. They directly use the functions and functional calls.

- Like OOP, functional programming languages support popular concepts such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

## functional Programming – Advantages
- Functional programming offers the following advantages −

- Efficiency − Functional programs consist of independent units that can run concurrently. As a result, such programs are more efficient.

- Supports Nested Functions − Functional programming supports Nested Functions.

# object-oriented programming (OOP) :

is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.
Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. Objects can communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages

## The structure, or building blocks, of object-oriented programming include the following:

- clases
- objects
- methods
- attributes

Programming languages designed primarily for OOP include:

- Java
- Python
- C++

Other programming languages that pair with OOP include:

- Visual Basic .NET
- PHP
- JavaScript

# Clases : 

In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword. The class is a blueprint that defines a nature of a future object. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class. Classes are used to create and manage new objects and support inheritance—a key ingredient in object-oriented programming and a mechanism of reusing code.

# Jest :

Introduction to Jest
Jest is a library for testing JavaScript code.

It’s an open source project maintained by Facebook, and it’s especially well suited for React code testing, although not limited to that: it can test any JavaScript code. Its strengths are:

- it’s fast
- it can perform snapshot testing
- it’s opinionated, and provides everything out of the box without requiring you to make choices
